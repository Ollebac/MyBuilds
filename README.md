## About
Within this project are 'mini' projects that are meant to showcase my knowledge of various concepts.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Get Started
To get started, clone the repo and run: `npm install`.

Then in the project directory, you can run `npm start` which will run the app in development mode. From here you can navigate to the various projects via the homepage.
